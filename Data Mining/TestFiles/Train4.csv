58954,Render of UIElement Causes App To Hang For Several Seconds,"<p>I have a WPF application - using MVVM for the design pattern.</p>

<p>In the Main View, there is a ContentPresenter that is bound to a property in the corresponding ViewModel.  I have type-referential datatemplate for the data type associated with that property.  Essentially, based on a certain action performed by the user, the ContentPresenter will display the data from a specific data template.  In the data template I have DevExpress' GridControl.  It sucks and I hate it, but due to company standards, I have to use it.  My main pain point is that it takes several noticable seconds for the UI to render to data template because of this GridControl.  Is there anything that I can do to mitigate this?  I'd like to display a ""please wait"" progress indicator, but even that gets stuck for several seconds...</p>

58958,"How to map ""special"" keys of the keyboard to some mappings in linux?","<p>I have recently bought a new keyboard, and it has a lot of unused special keys - like ""launch Excel"", ""launch Word"", etc. I suspect there is a way to map the keypresses on those keys to some useful actions (currently, they do absolutely nothing).</p>

<p>How can I do this?</p>

<p>NOTES:</p>

<p>This is the usb keyboard. I found out that while most of the normal keys provide some info via the <code>/dev/input/event2</code> device, half the normal keys (not catchable by xev) do some action on <code>/dev/input/event3</code>.</p>

<p>Both would be functionally equivalent, but when using cat wouldn't it be slower because you have a process first reading the file and then sending it through a pipe to another process, instead of the process just reading the file? But I've seen this usage 'cat file | program' in a lot of examples. I assume they wouldn't use it that much in examples if it had bad performance.</p>

58965,Comparison of Speech Recognition use in Android: by Intent or on-thread?,"<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Android provides two ways for me to use speech recognition. </p>

<p>The <strong>first</strong> way is by an <code>Intent</code>, as in this question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7335694/implementing-recognizerintent-in-android"">Intent example</a>. A new <code>Activity</code> is pushed onto the top of the stack which listens to the user, hears some speech, attempts to transcribes it (normally via the cloud) then returns the result to my app, via an <code>onActivityResult</code> call.</p>

<p>The <strong>second</strong> is by getting a <code>SpeechRecognizer</code>, like the code here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/4559930/705048"">SpeechRecognizer example</a>. Here, it looks like the speech is recorded and transcribed on some other thread, then callbacks bring me the results. And this is done <em>without leaving my <code>Activity</code></em>.</p>

<p>I would like to understand the <strong>pros and cons of these two ways of doing speech recognition</strong>.</p>

<h1>What I've got so far</h1>

<p>Using the <code>Intent</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>is simple to code</li>
<li>avoids reinventing the wheel</li>
<li>gives consistent user experience of speech recognition across the device</li>
</ul>

<p>but</p>

<ul>
<li>might be slow for the creation of a new activity with it's own window</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the <code>SpeechRecognizer</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>lets me retain control of UI in my app</li>
<li>gives me extra possibilities of things to respond to (<a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionListener.html"">documentation</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>but</p>

<ul>
<li>is limited to be called from the main thread</li>
<li>more control requires more error-checking.</li>

58967,Using Parsec with Data.Text,"<p>Using Parsec 3.1, it is possible to parse several types of inputs:</p>

<li><code>Data.ByteString</code> with <code>Text.Parsec.ByteString</code></li>
<li><code>Data.ByteString.Lazy</code> with <code>Text.Parsec.ByteString.Lazy</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't see anything for the <code>Data.Text</code> module. I want to parse Unicode content without suffering from the <code>String</code> inefficiencies.  So I've created the following module based on the <code>Text.Parsec.ByteString</code> module: </p>

<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances, MultiParamTypeClasses #-}
{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fno-warn-orphans #-}

module Text.Parsec.Text
    ( Parser, GenParser
    ) where

import Text.Parsec.Prim

import qualified Data.Text as T

instance (Monad m) =&gt; Stream T.Text m Char where
    uncons = return . T.uncons

type Parser = Parsec T.Text ()
type GenParser t st = Parsec T.Text st
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Does it make sense to do so?</li>
<li>It this compatible with the rest of the Parsec API?</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Additional comments: </p>

<p>I had to add <code>{-# LANGUAGE NoMonomorphismRestriction #-}</code> pragma in my parse modules to make it work.</p>

<p>Parsing <code>Text</code> is one thing, building an AST with <code>Text</code> is another thing.  I will also need to <code>pack</code> my <code>String</code> before return:</p>

<pre><code>module TestText where

import Data.Text as T

import Text.Parsec
import Text.Parsec.Prim
import Text.Parsec.Text

input = T.pack ""xxxxxxxxxxxxxxyyyyxxxxxxxxxp""

parser = do
  x1 &lt;- many1 (char 'x')
  y &lt;- many1 (char 'y')
  x2 &lt;- many1 (char 'x')
