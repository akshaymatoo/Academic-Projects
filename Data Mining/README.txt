This is a Kaggle competition project which predicts the tag of stack overflow questions.
The main idea behind the project is to build the model with the help of Classification technique . The classification technique i have used to build the model is the Naive Bayes classifier. Once the model is complete the test data is passed to predict the tags for those questions.

The test data was provided by Stackoverflow.com
The main file to run the project is Datamine.java

The folders RequiredJars contains the jars which are used by this project to run successfully.
The folder TestFiles contains the data provided by stack overflow on which i used Naive Bayes classifier.This folder also contains the Result.csv file which shows the output of the program.
