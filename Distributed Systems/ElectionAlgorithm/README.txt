Project Description:

The coordinator election problem is to choose a process from among a group of processes on different processors in a distributed system to act as the central coordinator.
An election algorithm is an algorithm for solving the coordinator election problem. By the nature of the coordinator election problem, any election algorithm must be a distributed algorithm.
-a group of processes on different machines need to choose a coordinator
-peer to peer communication: every process can send messages to every other process.
-Assume that processes have unique IDs, such that one is highest
-Assume that the priority of process Pi is i
